# Introduction

<p align="justify">
The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has caused countries across the world to implement unprecendented measures of social distancing to reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19. Such measures include school closures and national or regional lockdowns to urge people to stay at home to reduce the amount of physical contact people have on a day-to-day basis. This is widely regarded as one of the most effective ways to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 (Gu et al., 2020). Social distancing has disrupted the lives of entire populations (Caria et al., 2020), impacting on the mental wellbeing of many people, especially among those living in densely-populated urban settings with limited green public spaces.
The urban environment holds great influence over health, both directly and indirectly, through its impact on health-related behaviours (Bixby et al., 2015). The increase in chronic disease risk factors, for example, has been linked with urban living due to changing socio-economic, lifestyle and environmental factors (Allender et al., 2011). For this reason, disease prevention strategies that target the environment rather than individuals have gained support over recent years (Department of Health, 2004 & 2011).

Urban greenspace has been proven effetive in improving public health in the contemporary background of global urbanisation (Liu et al., 2019). Urban greenspace has therefore become an effective tool for planning healthy cities, offering not only critical ecosystem services but also significant physical and mental benefits (Shanahan et al., 2015). Furthermore, this research aims to provide a spatio-temporal overview of greenspace ad the global pandemic of COVID-19, to identify if an increase in urban greenspace can reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

# The Hackathon Brief

This is an entry for Covid-19 Hackathon 3: Ecosystem Services, run by the National Environmental Research Council (NERC). [Click here](https://digitalenvironment.org/home/covid-19-digital-sprint-hackathons/covid-19-hackathon-3-ecosystem-services/) to access the hackathon brief.



# Our Entry

<p align = "justify">
We hypothesised that the number of COVID-19 cases in urban areas reduce with increased availability of public green spaces. We included data on the number of fines issued for breaching of lockdown measures as a potential artifact of fewer local green spaces, further highlighting the importance of better planning in both established and future housing developments. We aim to show the importance of incorporating green space within cities to reduce risks of disease transmission, and subsequently propose a digital solution which allows such spaces to be used safely to further minimise risks while maximising the benefits they provide.

# Our Digital Solution - Urban Greenspace App

<p align = "justify">
As our digital solution to using ecosystem services and natural capital to control the transmission of COVID-19, we have developed a proposal for a 'Green Spaces App'. This app will permit users to check the status of their local greenspace for how busy it is, allowing for them to make an informed choice before leaving their home. 
The app involves users updating the app when they arrive at a green space, where they will be asked to provide a ranking for how busy it is. This feedback will be used to inform the 'traffic-light' system which users will be presented with when they enter their postcode and select their local greenspace. 
</p>


# Conclusions and Future Work

<p align = "justify">
Improved physical health associated with living near green spaces may reduce risk of comorbidities and help to improve immune system function of infected individuals. Including data on fatalities may reveal these additional benefits but this was not within the current scope of research. Furthermore, health is associated with socioeconomic status and air pollution, both of which are known to be factors that affect the severity of coronavirus. While crowded housing remains to be an issue in the transmission of disease amongst low-income communities, proximity to green spaces has been shown to almost halve health inequalities (Marmot, 2010), which may act as a significant buffer against death. Future work would benefit from the inclusion of such data.
