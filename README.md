# Abstract/Summary
<p align = "justify">
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many countries enforcing social distancing to reduce disease transmission. Although a vital step in preventing the spread of COVID-19, social distancing has impacted the mental wellbeing of many people. For those living in densely-populated urban areas, access to public greenspaces are limited; those greenspaces available, such as parks and playing fields, have the potential to easily become overcrowded due to high population densities.

# Introduction

<p align="justify">
The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has caused countries across the world to implement unprecendented measures of social distancing to reduce the rate of transmission of COVID-19. Such measures include school closures and national or regional lockdowns to urge people to stay at home to reduce the amount of physical contact people have on a day-to-day basis. This is widely regarded as one of the most effective ways to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 (Gu et al., 2020). Social distancing has disrupted the lives of entire populations (Caria et al., 2020), impacting on the mental wellbeing of many people, especially among those living in densely-populated urban settings with limited green public spaces.
The urban environment holds great influence over health, both directly and indirectly, through its impact on health-related behaviours (Bixby et al., 2015). The increase in chronic disease risk factors, for example, has been linked with urban living due to changing socio-economic, lifestyle and environmental factors (Allender et al., 2011). For this reason, disease prevention strategies that target the environment rather than individuals have gained support over recent years (Department of Health, 2004 & 2011).

<p align="justify">
Urban greenspace has been proven effetive in improving public health in the contemporary background of global urbanisation (Liu et al., 2019). Urban greenspace has therefore become an effective tool for planning healthy cities, offering not only critical ecosystem services but also significant physical and mental benefits (Shanahan et al., 2015). Furthermore, this research aims to provide a spatio-temporal overview of greenspace ad the global pandemic of COVID-19, to identify if an increase in urban greenspace can reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

# The Hackathon Brief

This is an entry for Covid-19 Hackathon 3: Ecosystem Services, run by the National Environmental Research Council (NERC). The brief for this hackathon is:
<p align = "justify">
* Can we understand whether/how a healthy natural environment modulates the spread of COVID-19? And whether changed human behaviours are having an impact on this? Can we use this insight to improve health outcomes?
</p>
<p align = "justify">
* Evidence-based support for decision makers and individuals to mitigate their environmental impact and reduce their personal health risk.
</p>
<p align = "justify">
Can we understand from landscape structure and function, the impact of natural capital and ecosystem services on how a healthy natural environment modulates the spread of COVID-19, and what benefits we may obtain from this that may lead to better COVID-19 related health outcomes? For instance, do diverse ecosystems suppress disease outbreaks? What characteristics of the natural environment modulates the disease dynamics? Is there evidence that exposure to nature/biodiversity lead to better health outcomes? How can we provide evidence-based support for individuals to allow them to mitigate their environmental impact and also reduce their personal health risk at the same time?

# Our Entry

<p align = "justify">
We have used a range of environmental and socio-economic data to explore if there is a relationship between urban greenspace and transmission of COVID-19. Data collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) was used in combination with land-use data from the Ordnance Survey to calculate population density per km<sup>2</sup> of green space in urban areas. This metric was compared against the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases for the 60 largest Upper Tier Local Authority areas in England, to understand if areas with higher population density per km<sup>2</sup> of greenspace also experienced higher number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.

# Our Digital Solution - Urban Greenspace App

<p align = "justify">
As our digital solution to using ecosystem services and natural capital to control the transmission of COVID-19, we have developed a proposal for a 'Green Spaces App'. This app will permit users to check the status of their local greenspace for how busy it is, allowing for them to make an informed choice before leaving their home. 
The app involves users updating the app when they arrive at a green space, where they will be asked to provide a ranking for how busy it is. This feedback will be used to inform the 'traffic-light' system which users will be presented with when they enter their postcode and select their local greenspace.
